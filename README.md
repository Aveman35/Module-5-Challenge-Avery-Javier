# Summary of analysis
1. The drugs, Capomulin and Ramicane, appear to be the most effective at reducing the tumor volume of all mice treated in this experiment. Quantitative analysis of the average tumor volume shows that mice treated with these two drugs had the lowest average measurable tumor volume. Further proof comes form these two drugs having the least amount of varience, and standard deviation compared to other drug treatments.

2. The correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume is very strong and significant. There is a direct correlation that the larger the mouse (measured by weight in grams) the larger the tumor volume would be, and the less a mouse weighed, the lower the tumor volume would be.

3. There appears to be incomplete data for Mouse ID c326, treated with Infubinol. After investigating the data, there are only two rows of data displaying treatment at timepoints 0 and 5, with a Tumor Volume significantly lower than any other mouse treated with Infubinol.
